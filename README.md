# Overview
This module aims to provide a new funcionality for the Community Core Vision (CCV) that could allow Hand, Fingers and Blobs recognition and Tracking, but most importantly to make an association and see if they belong to each other, and later to provide this information on the TUIO string, permiting the applications developers to make use of the new data on a wide range of applications. This project was developed by Thiago de Freitas Oliveira Ara√∫jo, mentored by Laurence Muller and with the guidance from the NuiGroup, during the Google Summer of Code 2009.
